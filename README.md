## Overview

Ryan's eleventy theme, shared between other projects. There is still room for improvement, but the general idea does work.

This is currently assuming it will only be used by Ryan, so things like the top navigation bar links and the footer links are coded directly into the theme. I may pursue making this theme more abstract where those values get set by data per site instead, but so far that seems like unnecessary work with no benefit unless others want to use this theme.
